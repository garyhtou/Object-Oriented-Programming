// =============================================================================
// This GridFlea class represents a Flea which can `move()` within a cartesian
// grid — either along the X or Y Axis. The direction (Axis) of travel
// alternates per `move()` and defaults to the X-axis on intialization.
//
// Throughout the lifetime of a GridFlea, it can be either in an Active,
// Inactive, or Dead (deactivated) State. Its State largely depend on the
// position of the GridFlea and its energy.
//
// Error handling for GridFlea is done through throwing Exceptions.

// =============================================================================
// --------------------------- INTERFACE INVARIANTS ----------------------------
// =============================================================================
// The constructor allows for the creation of Active, Inactive, and Dead
// GridFleas since there are scenarios where a client may want an Inactive
// or Dead GridFlea right off the bat. If a GridFlea was intialized with
// values which result in an Inactive/Dead state, resetting the GridFlea
// will bring it back to it's original Inactive/Dead state. Default values
// are provided for the constructor.
//
// The GridFlea class provides multiple methods for retriving the state of the
// GridFlea. You can either use the `GetState()` method which returns a value
// from the `State` enum (Active, Inactive, Dead). Or, the GridFlea class also
// provides boolean methods for each state as syntatic sugar.
//   - `IsActive()`: Whether the GridFlea is in an Active state.
//   - `IsInactive()`: Whether the GridFlea is in an Inactive state.
//   - `IsDead()`: Whether the GridFlea is in a Dead state.

// =============================================================================
// ------------------------ IMPLEMENTATION INVARIANTS --------------------------
// =============================================================================
// The GridFlea's overall state is managed with the following private variables:
//   - `x` (and `initX`)
//   - `y` (and `initY`)
//   - `size`. This never changes.
//   - `energy` (and `initEnergy`)
//   - `reward` (and `initReward`)
//   - state. Represented by an enum: Active, Inactive, and Dead.
//   - direction. Represented by an enum: X or Y.
//
// All state transitions are delayed until necessary and handled by the
// `GetState` method — except for a single `Active` -> `Dead` state transition
// in the `move()` method. That single state transition is necessary to handle
// the edge case of an Integer Overflow when a GridFlea tries to move far
// beyond its bound. This architecture was choosen as it allows for most state
// transition rules to be contains in one location (the `GetState()` method).
//
// The possible states and directions of a GridFlea is defined by the `State`
// and `Axis` enums, respectively. These enums allow for easy addition of
// additional states and axes when necessary. The possible states also have
// syntatic sugar methods (`IsActive()`, `IsInactive()`, `IsDead()`) to help
// the client write cleaner code.
//
// Both the GridFlea constructor and `Revive()` methods depend on the `Setup()`
// method which promotes code resuse by handling the setting of current
// variables equal to the initial variables defined in the constructor.
//
// Error handling is done through throwing Exceptions.
