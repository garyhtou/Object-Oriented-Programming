// =============================================================================
// This GridFlea class represents a flea which can `move()` within a cartesian
// grid â€” either along the X or Y axis. The direction (Axis) of travel
// alternates per `move()` and defaults to the X axis on initialization.
//
// Throughout the lifetime of a GridFlea, it can either in an Active, Inactive,
// or Dead (deactivated) state. Its State largely depends on the position of the
// GridFlea.
//
// Error Handling for GridFlea is done through throwing Exceptions.

// =============================================================================
// --------------------------- INTERFACE INVARIANTS ----------------------------
// =============================================================================
// `GridFlea()` (Constructor):
//   - Creates a new GridFlea using the given arguments.
//   - Supports creation using default arguments
//   - Allows for creation of GridFleas in an Active, Inactive, or Dead state
//     since there are scenarios where a client may want an Inactive or Dead
//     GridFlea right off the bat.
// `reset()`:
//   - Resets the GridFlea back to its original state (as defined by the
//     arguments provided to the constructor).
//   - You can not reset a Dead GridFlea.
//   - If a GridFlea was initialized in an Inactive state, resetting
//     that GridFlea will bring it back to its original Inactive state.
// `revive()`:
//   - Provides an Inactive GridFlea with a new energy value.
//   - You can not revive a Dead GridFlea.
// `move()`:
//   - Moves the GridFlea in the direction it is currently facing.
//   - You can only move an Active GridFlea.
//   - Moving a GridFlea may result in it becoming Inactive or Dead.
// `value()`:
//   - Returns the value of the GridFlea.
//   - You can only get the value of an Active GridFlea.
//
// The GridFlea class provides multiple query methods for retrieving the state
// of the GridFlea. You can either use the `getState()` method which returns a
// value from the `State` enum (Active, Inactive, Dead). Or, the GridFlea class
// also provides boolean methods for each state as syntatic sugar.
//   - `isActive()`: Whether the GridFlea is in an Active state.
//   - `isInactive()`: Whether the GridFlea is in an Inactive state.
//   - `isDead()`: Whether the GridFlea is in a Dead state.
