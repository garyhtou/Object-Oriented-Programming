1) Parameter passing
- Callback function. Pass in functions for different behaviors each time you call it
- Logic to act upon parameters passed into the function
- A function can call another function and act upon its return value (which can differ)


2) Heterogeneous collection
- Due to virtual functions, calling a function on various objects may result in different functionality.
	- Overridden functions


What is the difference between #1 and #2 above?
Since Heterogeneous collection uses virtual functions, it overrides/uses the vtab. However, with parameter passing, all the function pointer code is handled by the programmer and as a result, there are no edits to the vtab.
