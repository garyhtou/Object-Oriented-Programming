C# options
- single inheritance w/ composition
  - parent is the one with strong type association (`leapFrog`)
- double composition
  - allows for dependency injection
  - you then need to echo functionality
- type absorption
  - copy and paste. but it's a maintainability problem
- redefine type hierarchy
  - great option when converting between languages
