Inheritance vs Composition (Design Choice Impacts)

Composition:
- Harder to read
- Dependency injection
  - Validating types (passing in the wrong type)
  - Inconsistency from method injection
  - Delayed instansitation (checking for existance)
- Hard/impossible to do heterogenous collections
  - There might not be a base class handle
